                 At the tender age of 23, he gave his life for the country, an epitome of bravery, a man of extraordinary wisdom and vision.
                 <br>
                 Criticised for his violent and anarchist approach of freedom struggle, sidecasted by the mainstream historians, the efforts and genius of this man has been overlooked since his matyrdom. It's time to revive this man who is lost in the pages of history books.

                  </strong>
                  - For some time, Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy.  In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. Bhagat was a prominent member of the HSRA.

                  </strong>
                  -  On 8 April 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery while it was in session. The bombs had been designed not to kill, but some members, including George Ernest Schuster, the finance member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, were injured. The smoke from the bombs filled the Assembly so that Singh and Dutt could probably have escaped in the confusion had they wished. Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan "Inquilab Zindabad!" ("Long Live the Revolution") and threw leaflets. The two men were arrested and subsequently moved through a series of jails in Delhi.

                  - He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail. There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to be a political prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike.They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper.

                    1931
                  </strong>
                    - Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh's hanging as was required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had expired. The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river.

                  <strong>Excerpt from Bhagat Singh's letter to the punjab governor after his death sentence was passed by the British court -
                  </strong>
                  <br>
                  "We wanted to point out that according to the verdict
                   of your court we had waged war and were therefore war prisoners.
                   And we claim to be treated as such, i.e.,
                   we claim to be shot dead instead of to be hanged."
